Top comment:

""In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.

""String theory is a broad and varied subject that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. String theory has been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. Because string theory potentially provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. Despite much work on these problems, it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world or how much freedom the theory allows to choose the details.

""String theory was first studied in the late 1960s as a theory of the strong nuclear force, before being abandoned in favor of quantum chromodynamics. Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. The earliest version of string theory, bosonic string theory, incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons. It later developed into superstring theory, which posits a connection called supersymmetry between bosons and the class of particles called fermions. Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions known as M-theory. In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship called the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a quantum field theory.

""One of the challenges of string theory is that the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. Another issue is that the theory is thought to describe an enormous landscape of possible universes, and this has complicated efforts to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory. These issues have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to physics and question the value of continued research on string theory unification.""

""A couple of months ago /u/hero0fwar came up with an idea to get a couple of gif makers, split up a music video, and gif the whole thing with as much creativity as possible. The first music video got us over half a million views across multiple platforms. Now, HQG Studios is back with our second music video. This project has now grown from 17 to 21 gif makers. Each person got a 10-20 second part of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' 'Thrift Shop' video and created whatever their hearts desired as long as the timing of the video remained intact.""

Audio descriptions make films accessible to blind cinephiles, but sometimes, they change the entire tone of the film, as u/bonzo1314 discovered by accident.

""The other night I decided to watch Zootopia on Netflix after hearing it was a pretty good movie. And it was, I haven't laughed so hard at a film in a while. What I thought was really funny was how it was narrated as if it were some sort of Animal Planet documentary. Some of the lines spoken were so matter-of-fact, direct, obvious, etc. that I completely lost it several times.
As it turns out, I accidentally turned on Audio Description somehow. I was actually pretty disappointed to find this out, because I think the movie becomes a lot funnier when it's turned on.""

After Martin had the remains of his ruptured eyes surgically removed, u/Marmie_McMom gave him a new home—only to find that her first cat, Miss Kitty, didn't like him. So u/Marmie_McMom got creative and decided to let Martin adopt his OWN cat.

Read the full story below, check out the post on r/cats for more pics and videos (redd.it/54syu1), and follow Martin on Facebook here: Martin tucker.

------------------------------------------
From u/Marmie_McMom:

""When Martin arrived in our home we tried to introduce him to our 14-year-old Miss Kitty. Unfortunately, Miss Kitty was an only cat for 14 years and she immediately vowed to hate Martin's guts for the rest of her life.

This made blind Martin very sad. He cried outside her bedroom door every day while she stood on the other side hissing and being very angry that he existed.

We decided the only thing left to do was make a trip to the local shelter. We explained the problem and how we wanted to adopt but needed Martin to meet the potential family member before we brought him or her home. After all, the last thing we needed was to have three cats who couldn't stand each other! They gave us access to a 'greeting' room designed for this very thing!

We ran home and gathered Martin and off we went. We did have to pass the barking dogs but Martin—who had lived on the streets for several months—was not bothered by the barking.

Several potential cats were brought in. We first tried a kitten. He had zero interest in that. Then, a rather skittish orange tabby came in, but they stayed on opposite sides of the room.

Then comes this pretty, two-year-old tuxedo cat. They smelled each other and touched noses. He knew. And we knew that this was the guy. We named him Mr. Pinkerton and Martin brought him home.

We paid the adoption fee and these boys are now inseparable. Miss Kitty begrudgingly tolerates them, but now they have each other.""",Photos from Reddit's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/reddit/photos/a.10150220507938735.343687.7177913734/10154534598898735/?type=3,2016-09-28 14:33:04,2961,213,307,2003,830,6,2,120,0,0

An original script by u/CurryThighs
---------------------------------------------
MICHAEL is wandering around the Office staring at his phone, when he shouts in excitement.

MICHAEL
Ooh! I got one. There's one right here!

Michael clambers over the desk of PHYLLIS, knocking her items about. He reaches his destination and swipes his phone a couple of times before jumping for joy and smiling into the camera.

MICHAEL
Gotcha!

MICHAEL TALKING HEAD

MICHAEL
""Pokemon Go!"" is a revolution, quite simply. It get's you up and out of your chair so you can go catch Pokemon. It's a little distracting from my work, but I think it's worth it. My absolute favourite Pokemon is Pekingchu.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

PAM, JIM and ANGELA are watching Michael out of the window. He is again using his phone in the parking lot. He suddenly runs onto the road and a car swerves to avoid him.

DWIGHT TALKING HEAD

DWIGHT
Yes, I know of ""Pokemon Go!"". It's attracted many unwanted loiterers to my farm. Apparently it's a Pokemon hotspot.

INT. SCHRUTE FARM - EVENING

Dwight is sat in a rocking chair, smoking a pipe and whittling a chunk of wood into a statuette of a bear.

DWIGHT - V/O
At first I thought they were the O' Donnell boys come to steal my harvest.

A shuffling noise comes from outside. Dwight leaps up, signalling the documentary crew to come closer.

DWIGHT - V/O (CONT'D)
I soon wised up to them, though. And set about placing counter measures.

Outside the window are four teenagers huddled round their phones. Dwight smiles at the camera as he rings a bell near the window. Outside, a door slams open and MOSE runs out wearing an obviously Schrute-made costume designed to scare them off. Feathers, straw, mud. The teenagers flee and Dwight nods to the camera.

DWIGHT TALKING HEAD

DWIGHT
The costume was pretty simple. I just threw together some feathers, hay and of course the manure to keep it all together.

EXT. SCHRUTE FARM - DAY

Dwight is rubbing manure all over Mose, neither seem bothered by the smell. Michael turns the corner, phone in hand, and Mose chases him away.

MICHAEL
Oh, God!

Dwight chases after them both.

DWIGHT
No, Mose! Wait!

Here's an excerpt of how it went:
--------------------------------------------------------
HIM: I'm pretty sure we're going to eat this teacher alive.

ME: Why?

HIM: He's a first year teacher. They never know what the hell they're doing. All they ever do is stick to the textbook and generally suck.

ME: Do you know anything else about this Mr. Augustane?

HIM: No, not really, but he's probably going to be really slow and boring. First year teachers always are. He won't have control of this class. I don't think he'll be any good.

At that moment, I put my hand on his shoulder, and said something along the lines of ""Don't worry buddy, I'm sure I'll do fine"" before stepping up to the class and revealing myself. 

The class really did go apeshit, but for different reasons.

""I live in Munich, where as everybody now probably heard the shooting in the shopping centre happenend. I was all day out catching Pokemon and since weather worsened, I headed back home. I came from the Olympiapark on my bike still stopping to catch pokemon, when they popped up. I was at the back entrance of the OEZ at 17:49 and caught a Drowzee. I went around the west side of the shopping mall stopping at the subway entrance for a pidgey and the poke stop. This was at 17:52. I went to the front of the shopping mall to get sth from McD before heading home. People were in turmoil, but I didnt know why so I went ahead.I stopped at the stoppinf light in front of the entrance of the OEZ to get to the McD on the onther side of the street. Now I realized there were people on the ground not moving on the other side. A car war parked besides them. Then I heard 6 gunshots from the inside of the OEZ. I did not think twice and started pedalling away to my home which is like only 200m away from the OEZ. My flatmates are all safe as well.""

7177913734_10153898827963735,"What would the world look like if everyone had access to the same level of education? What could we accomplish?

Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, is working to make education available to anyone, anywhere in the world, for free—with programs hosted entirely in the cloud. In this episode of Formative, Khan relates how an informal tutoring session for his cousin and a sci-fi novel by Isaac Asimov led him to create a not-for-profit that reached over 100 million students in the past year alone.

Khan and his sister were born in Metairie, La. and raised by their mother, who immigrated to the US from India. 

“We weren’t well off,” he shares in the video.

Khan’s early life was heavily influenced by his hardworking mother and an equally intelligent older sister whose previous success in school helped her brother get fast-tracked into the gifted program. There Khan met teachers who encouraged him to explore all of his interests and, in doing so, spurred an early love of learning. 

“Now when I look back,” he recalls, “that program is what kept my curiosity from being squashed.”

After attending MIT and Harvard, Khan went on to become a hedge fund analyst in Boston. While he was earning a lot of money, he wasn’t following his passion for education. He considered becoming a professor, but found that professors spend more of their time on research than education.

So he started out tutoring his younger cousins in math and creating videos for them to watch before they met with him for tutoring sessions. What he found was that his cousins were learning more from the videos, and the first cousin he took on as a pupil went from the bottom of the class to the very top in less than six months. 

His videos started to gain traction outside of his family. As the view counts grew exponentially, Khan made the decision along with his wife to commit one year to turning his educational work into a full-time not-for-profit.

Khan’s work drew the interest of many philanthropists, but after expressing interest in his program, they declined to get involved. His luck turned when he met Ann Doerr, who gave him his first major investment—of $100,000.

Today, Khan Academy has millions of students, with programs in 36 languages, and is bringing free education to the masses.",Formative: Sal Khan,link,http://buff.ly/23s2Jmq,2016-01-26 21:45:13,216,9,50,216,0,0,0,0,0,0

7177913734_10153859932218735,"Good news everyone! School lunches officially suck less—at least, when it comes to nutrition.

Five years ago, President Obama signed the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) increasing standards on what can be served in schools. According to researchers out of the Center for Public Health Nutrition at the University of Washington, Seattle, the program has had a significant effect, reducing calories while upping nutritional adequacy.

The program, which required schools to serve meals more closely aligned with the (recently updated) Dietary Guidelines, enacted calorie restrictions and portion-size recommendations, put limits on trans-fats, and increased the amount of produce and whole grains included at lunchtime.

In a longitudinal study published in JAMA Pediatrics, researchers evaluated around 1.7 million school meals served at six schools between 2011 and 2014. Collecting data 16 months prior to implementation of HHFKA and 15 months after, they looked at calories in each meal along with six key nutrients—calcium, vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, fiber, and protein—and found HHFKA helped cause a 17 percentage point bump in nutrition.",New Standards On School Lunches Are Actually Helping Kids Stay Healthy,link,http://buff.ly/1K0VxBZ,2016-01-07 22:43:01,365,51,19,365,0,0,0,0,0,0

Greenfield and his brother, Mike, are professional cooks—despite lacking a background in professional training. The two picked up the skill through poring over cookbooks, ol’ fashioned practice, and, of course, television.

The Brothers Greenfield also have their own YouTube channel, which features everyday, achievable solutions like how to get creative with pancake batter, amazing ramen tricks, and recipes using just eggs. So it wasn’t too surprising when Josh announced a new series: He will be cooking and eating three meals a day, all for $1 each. That’s $3 a day and $21 total for an entire week.

It’s a daunting challenge in this Seamless- and Postmates-driven world—especially in very pricey Manhattan—but the Greenfields hope that the video series will alter the way we view food forever.
