Every artist as a rise, prime, and a decline. Eminem clearly isn't in his prime anymore. The music scene has changed. He's at a great point in life, doesnt have to deal with his fucked up mother or his bitch exwife. So his writing style and ability over time will change.

So yes. He's well past his prime. He's still producing music. And all of these artists wanted to perform with him for a reason: because its Eminem.

You just don't like it bc its not something usually heard in mainstream rap. Bc the mainstream has been conditioned to like elementary easy to follow flows. The flow he uses atm is usually syncopated and often shadow boxed and requires tremendous skill and complete knowledge of a beat. But I bet all you hear is off beat. Its not. Not even a little bit. He's rhyming on upbeats and downbeats. He's crossing the bar with his schemes and mixing them in pretty complex patterns. In other words...what a real MC does.

Zeven A. Viero y'all consider him the rap God... What is he evolving into? A pop God? Emo cry baby? I don't get it.

Walk on water was made for the fans that idolize him as such. He wants you to stop,but still give him your money.

Eminem considers you a retard and the idea of being a Rap God ridiculous. All from his own mouth.

Face it. I honestly give a shit less about features. He reached out to the pop stars for features with a Christmas release date in a desperate attempt to stay relevant and take your money. Which in no way suggest the album will suck.

Yet walk on water did.

Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish, whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent

Ems biggest fans would understand that the movie has just begun, he released this song first(and an amazing song all together being that it is with Beyonc√© who recently had a fallout with Jay so some might say a lil aftermath payback to collaborate with tresthe wife of the guy he murdered on his track while claiming to be the greatest rapper of all time lol) so that everyone thinks he has lost his character and confidence. The  of the album is going to be monumental, he‚Äôs even collaborating with X Ambassadors.

This thread is filled with a shit ton of fucktards. 

He is no God. No we don't give a fuck...<- sound familiar? He use to be able to have a message while maintaining a flow on a hot beat. If I wanna hear emo crybaby feel bad for me,there are a lot better options out there for that trash. 

The dude doesn't give two shits about any of his fans. He has made that clear. Y'all act like y'all have some personal connection with a dude that would rather not know you exist.

Stop saying he evolved. He has done the opposite. I guess Jessica and Britney turned him down when he was out begging for pop features.

I understand what he is doing. Selling you some shit,and you eat it all up.

Look at the CD. Listen to wow. Check the features and release date. Nothing more than a desperate attempt to make Christmas sales.

He hasn't done shit. He has made some music. Like that is some triumph feat. 

He is not the best rapper in the game anymore. And he only held that title through his first 3 known cds. 

I like him,I've bought most of his albums. 

If something sucks people have the right to their opinions. Just like the douchebag y'all are defending. The one who doesn't give a fuck about you,only the money you're willing to spend on him.

Even in the underground rap, mumble bullshit is just a subgenre but it's not the only. I genuinely hate mumble rap so I'm not disagreeing with you there. But I think that every generation spawns some greats (from other sub genres) that carry it forward; Kendrick Lamar, J Cole, Logic, Chance the rapper, Tyler the creator, Childish Gambino, etc. But as for mumble rap, I think it will die off or remain as pure hype music, but it won't evolve on a higher scale consciously. Every generation has come out with trash artists that never last and never leave a lasting legacy is my point, reason being is the art that resonates in a deeper level becomes universal.

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‚ÄòNo, this is my first time.‚Äô

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‚ÄòJust a minute,‚Äô she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‚ÄòDo these excite you?‚Äô She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‚ÄòWell, come on‚Äô, she said, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äô So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‚ÄòDid you put that condom on?‚Äô she asked.

I said, ‚ÄòI sure did,‚Äô and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted.‚Äù",Gary Baxter,2017-12-05 12:37:06,555,318,2,7,214,8,6,0

""Don't listen if you don't like""? That is a weak argument, because I *want* to listen something good that he does.

We all liked Rap God or Berserk out of his newest tracks, because they were close to his golden age kind of rapping.

Please jump off Em's dick for a minute and realize there are other great artist out there. Eminem is a rap legend and helped pave the way for so many these days! No one can deny that. But give credit where credit is due. Tech has been doing it big for those on the independent front for over a decade now! The man has bars and a crazy ass flow and keeps hitting us with a new album or 2 every damn year!! The man puts in work and often doesn't get as much recognition or credit as he should. Hell, Kendrick Lamar is an undeniable presents in hip hop and if you look back Strange Music is what kind helped TDE get to the place they're at now! They would have gotten there eventually regardless I'm sure. But Tech N9ne and Strange Music played their part.... As for Token. The kid is basically this generation's Eminem. The young man raps and he does it extremely well. Like Em he cares about the craft and has a love for word play! The boy isn't even 20 yet and look at what he's been able to accomplish on his own

Hip-hop owes a lot to Eminem and he will forever go down as one of the best to ever do it. But times are changing and new wordsmith's pop up each year looking for just an ounce of the glory that Em had back in his day. And if we're being real. Eminem is where he's at today because of the timing and circumstances around him from when he first came out.. Sure the man has undeniable talent and skill. But so do a lot of other artist. But when Marshall Mathers stepped onto the scene he just had all the ingredients to create the perfect storm. Him and his label put the pieces together in the right way and they shook up the industry! But if he came out today I guarantee even with all of his skill he wouldn't make the same impact as he was able to in the late 90s... #CalmDownStan",Cody Donahue,2017-12-05 13:25:25,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

The stuff he's writing about rn is from the pit of his soul, and it's pretty great. But if you keep comparing his present self to his past self, then you'll undoubtedly be listening to the music in a jaded light.

Personally think walk on water is one of the realist songs he's put out since the 'slim shady LP' & 'MMLP' raw vocals and emotion in the track. 

So how about everyone stops bitching & whining. Enjoy the album, he's always said he makes each album sound completely different to the last  & always worked with a wide verity of people i.e. Elton John, Marilyn Manson, Dido, is everyone forgetting him working with those people?
