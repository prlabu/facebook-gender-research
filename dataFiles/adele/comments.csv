Yes Adele is gutted but she also has millions in the bank & made the choice to tour as much as she did to cancel.

I am one of those who flew half a planet to London from Seattle to see the show on Sunday.  I have already checked into my hotel in London.  The trip has started and consumed.  So insurance will not pay for that.  The show ticket is refundable up to the ticket value.  I got it at the official website at face value, so insurance will pay nothing since I will lose nothing.
I was in London last year when Adele was in my city.  I came to London again solely to see her show.  I would have definitely gone to another city if it were not for Adele.  I totally understand this is uncontrollable by Adele, but I can't hide my emotion and just say I am ok and not disappointed.  I am hoping the shows will be re-scheduled rather than an out right cancellation.  By re-scheduling, I will fly half a planet again to see her.

My husband and I watched your concerts on March 4, 2016 in Dublin and June 28, 2017 in London. You are such an amazing artist with a big heart! üëèüëèüëèThe weather was really not nice during Adele's first of 4 finale concerts in London and performing in Wembley stadium in that kind of weather will definitely affect her voice. One need not to be a doctor to know this for a fact. As for us who chose to travel to see a concert, we should always be prepared for the outcome of the risk that we have taken. Watching concert abroad is quite risky because there's a lot of money at stake from plane tickets, hotel accomodations, taking time off from work (for those who wouldn't be there if not for the concert) and the concert tickets. For the concert tickets, of course it is refundable. Problem arises when tickets are sold out and the only way to get tickets is from ticket touts. Unfortunately tickets bought from ticket touts will not be refunded by Songkick. That is another risk that a person should expect when buying tickets from ticket touts. It is understandable that people get frustrated because of disappointment over something you look forward to for so many months and incurred losses, especially for those who save up and travelled to London just to watch Adele live. For those who are travelling to watch a concert, always remember, it's good to have a back up plan (think of other things you can do in case the concert has been cancelled). For now, just make something good out of the situation, make an alternative plan. üòÑ So at least your trip to London is not totally a waste of money. üòò",Camille Misty Pedersen,2017-07-01 14:59:09,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just because someone says something that you don't understand, the way it is written, doesn't mean what one thinks it means. Remember that Kelly Clarkson was told that she may never sing again when her vocal chords were damaged? And, like Adele, also went through the throat surgery, and returned to singing; just not like she used to. People thought Kelly may have quit because of it, but she didn't, and neither had Adele. The fact that she has touched so many people with her music is amazing. You guys attacking this man is just showing a lack of understanding, because as someone said earlier maybe English isn't his first language; because translating from one language to another (especially to English) there can be a loss of wording, or the wrong word completely. Yes, fans would be disappointed, but from the note that she wrote Adele feels that same disappointment.",William Hanes,2017-06-30 19:46:28,13,12,1,0,0,0,0,0

For 98000 fans at each show they need to make.sure the Information is correct and she's only found out this morning so probably needs more tests to see how severe it is. Yes she's lost people money but this would be the last thing they intended so give them time to sort it no show will be happening soon so stop making stupid comments like this !!,Emily Rymchuk,2017-07-01 04:01:30,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

She has now damaged her vocals chords ( I do hope she gets well soon), Jesus is that really a surprise given her singing style?? Maybe sticking to the original plan instead of adding dates  should have been thought through in more detail. 
Luckily it's only the price of a couple tickets that will be refunded but many have hotel rooms booked and a whole lot more that won't be reimbursed.
Finally before you all start slagging me off, ain't it only a couple of years ago that she cancelled a host of shows in the States due to damaged vocal chords?

I wonder if you feel good with yourself bashing me like that.

To those who didn't read what i wrote and decided what i had in mind, here it goes again:
1. I don't want her to perform - she is sick! Health comes first.
2. Shit happens.. I know. This time it is not the case.
3. This part you fail to understand - SHE performed well for 121 shows but when she comes to London.. her home.. she pushed it since she wanted to make the best show ever. She got excited and didn't keep control on delicate voice.
When you are a professional - you keep control while you know you still have 2 shows to go.
4. Adele knows her condition with her voice cords.. she wouldn't be surprised. She had a surgery there in the past but still she decided to push it.
You may say - ""she gives everything for you and you complain"", yes I am!! Be a professional - know your limits so 200k people of the next 2 shows will be able to see you.

Nothing unprofessional in anything that has happened, she saw a Dr and the medical advice is DO NOT sing. Pretty simple really.

I am not fully agree with you.. but at least you tried to talk nice. 

Just to clarify.. like me there are other 200k people. Some of us are not from London and came from all over the globe.  Cancelling now has no meaning. I will just make other plans. I will enjoy my stay.
The frustration is just because it took me hell to plan this trip just for Adele. Its the peak of my stay and the reason i came.

There is no need for insurance as you understand.

In addition - there is no need to curse other people.
I didn't curse anyone!! I wasn't even selfish saying ""Adele.. i want you to be there no matter what"". I said that she could be more professional. Thats all.

I'd like to point out to you that even the healthiest of voices can develop problems such a nodules - it's not always down to a ""ideal"" technique. I happen to know that Adele had seen a top leading voice expert, the issue does not like with her technique and she has really learnt to not use what we call ""pressed phonation"" (which is what I believe you're referring to).

If you're an athlete and you train and stretch appropriately, there is still no 100% guarantee that you won't pull or tear muscle - and If this happens it doesn't make you unprofessional, but human. The voice is a very versatile and complex instrument. But there has been no unprofessionalism from this marvellous women. 

I know it's really sad for fans who don't get to see their hero, but voice has to be rested to stop any further unhealthy vocal production from occurring. 

Added note: 
It's not that she ""pushed"" in her last two concerts that has caused swelling of the vocal folds. This is very often something that happens over a long period of time, even by spoken voice and with a good technique to ""support"" the larynx (voice-box)

Spent ages sorting out hotel and transport at extortionate prices. I'm 21 and work at Sainsbury's and it took me a while to save up the money for your show hotel and everything else. I understand that if your voice isn't up for it then you shouldn't do the show. But what about all the money from the tickets that has been making interest since November. Somebody should have said this is too risky doing 4 shows in a row. Somebody should have said lets have a gap between each one. Adele is one of the richest women in the world. And all these fans including me have spent so much money and time organising their trips for the shows. I don't know if I can call myself a fan anymore. Questioning whether real legends (which I thought she was) do things like this. Absolutely devastated. I know most artists don't do a big apology like that and I appreciate that. However the amount of people losing money that aren't rich and travelling from afar is a very big number. It's easy for all the fans who weren't going or who've seen her on the other 2 nights to comment but when you've spent over 500 pounds organising it, it's a different matter. It's not selfish. Its about a combined substantial loss/waste of money from her fanbase who like I said have travelled from afar etc. London is not a cheap city to stay in.

The morning they went on sale, we were in Prague so my husband and I spent the final four hours of our stay on phones and tablets in our hotel room trying in vain to get onto the ticketing site. We were gutted but that's life. When, last year you released more tickets, we tried again - this time successfully (!) and had to keep that secret for the rest of that year so we could give them to Anna for her 2016 Christmas present. Needless to say she was so excited - and has been from then to now. Right now she is still asleep and is unaware of your sad news. BUT when she wakes up and hears that Sunday is cancelled she will, of course, have a moment of disappointment. Then she will worry for you, she will wish you well with your recovery, she will feel sad that you are so upset, she will say that you have let no-one down and she will look forward to seeing you another time, when your voice is better.

Even the best trained voices in the world will suffer on a schedule like this eventually so give her a break! It hurts like fuck when your vocal chords are damaged trust me and irs the absolute worst thing for a singer to be told there's something up with your voice and you can't sing. This isn't a decision her, or those around her, will have taken lightly...as she says herself (and not many artists living in their in their little bubbles get this) she knows the expense and planning etc it's taken some of you to be able to be there. She's not cancelled cause she's got a cold! Let me out it to you this way...if your moaning about her cancelling imagine how much more yiud be bloody moaning if she got on stage and your there all excited and then...she sounded dreadful or worse...nothing came out! Respect her as an artist and a performer enough to let her heal and recover and then put on the show the fans deserve and she as the artist deserves to give you. Let her do it justuce.  She is truly amazing live! As for what you should do...pretty obvs really for those with common sense...call your ticket issuer they will have the relevant refund/reschedule info asap. If you're daft enough to live somewhere she's already played but choose to fly to a different country to see her well...that's up to you...and your airline but it's not meant to be.

I am sure you and your team have thought of everything but just in case!!   Your live singing is absolutely identical to your recorded singing - which is AMAZING -so why don't you have the shows where you are on stage but don't sing!!  Instead your recorded videos could be played on the round screens and in between the songs you could entertain the crowds with snippets of memories from your tour.  You can still refund the price of the tickets but those already gathered in London will still be entertained by you and you will have completed the tour.  Having been to your concerts in both Adelaide and Auckland I can say without a doubt that your singing was THE best I have ever heard live however what really made the show was your interaction with the crowd between songs. Hopefully someone in your team is reading all these comments and sees mine üòò,Tracey McKenzie,2017-06-30 20:50:33,18,17,1,0,0,0,0,0

Here's a little poem I wrote for you on Thursday. Hope you get chance to read it. X

Adele! 

It's Thursday night & we're right here At Wembley to see Adele 
Her voice is just so magical 
She'll put us under her spell 

A massive crowd has gathered 
Just to listen to Adele 
There's over ninety thousand 
Tickets were quick to sell 

Anticipation is building 
As we're waiting for Adele 
She's gonna come out swearing 
'Hello Wembley, fucking hell!' 

The eyes on the big screen open 
Beautiful eyes of Adele 
She starts to sing 'Hello' 
And the crowd sing along as well  
After a few songs she stops to chat In the style of Adele 
'My songs are just moaning 'bout ex's' 'That's the story I always tell' 

An angry & serious moment 
With a heartfelt plea from Adele 
To donate & support the survivors Of the tragedy that was Grenfell 

A spectacle of lighting & fireworks As videos scrolled of Adele 
She shot t-shirts into the crowd 
And put notes on confetti that fell  
Thanks for the fantastic concert 
We hope you heard us yell 
Your music is bloody awesome 
We love you Adele, Adele!

This is Adele's day job, and just like with ANY day job, if you call the boss telling him/her you're gonna be too sick to work about a month from now, you're not gonna get a positive reply.
When you're sick you call in sick, and the more people that depend on you being at your job, the longer you try to fight off illness and ""just do it"".
When an artist cancel a sold out arena due to illness you can bet your butt that she or he is really REALLY sick.
I get it, things cost money. I have, believe it or not, been in the exact same situation. Flew to the event, stayed at a hotel and was in the arena AT THE GIG when it was cancelled. So I get it.
But to be pissed off at an artist for not performing when physically unable to is just bad form.
You lost some money on this, suck it up. You'll either get your ticket money back, or you'll get a fucking AWESOME replacement gig in the near future.",Micke Karlsson,2017-07-01 11:57:14,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, now we are the ones who are losing out on the experience. We are in no way blaming her, as it's probably more of the fault of the management or whoever is in control of the number of shows. I think getting to the show was a huge dream of loads of people who have to work and save a lot to be able to afford to do so, including us.

My partner, The mother of our two children, Maayan Erlich Linav,  has breast cancer stage 4.

Maayan dreamed about your concert, and finally felt good enough to travel to London too see it.  Maybe the last concert she will ever see.
Unfortunatly the show was cancelled. Maayan and her friends are deeply disappointed.
Maybe you could do something for her?... she admires you.
She would be thrilled to meet you or get a message from you.
I hope you Will feel better soon.
Maayan is in London until Wednesday 5 of july
Thank you for your attention

There needs to be more education and support for singers and to help people understand that the instrument of the voice is not the same as another like a guitar or piano. The vocals and heart are linked. If someone is tired then their vocals are affected. If someone is going through a personal situation, their vocals are affected. If you speak too loud at a family gathering one day then the vocals are affected the next day. Just a few examples. I cannot imagine the huge pressure to have to sing perfectly every single time and at every single concert. The ""people"" behind these artists need to look after their artists more and their instrument, their voices. There is a reason why legendary singers like Bette Midler will only sing once a week maximum. It is sad to me to see artists feeling so guilty and so sad for something that is essentially out of their control - the voice is a powerful but sensitive instrument. This is beyond her control. 121 shows was pushing it already.

It is superfluous to say how disappointed we was last morning noticing that the show was canceled. Most of the people who were supposed to attend the concert are not from London, not event from UK. They had to book flights and hotel. What about these expenses? We were highly disappointed for the ruined weekend but we still understood Adele's reasons for not performing last night. After receiving the information that the concerts won't be performed at all in future for which we will get refund and that if there are any concerts, we will have to purchase tickets again, I can't remain silent. Does Adele even suppose what a battle was for purchasing these tickets??? Does she know how did she ruin some people's dreams? I guess, No. She was obliged to reschedule the last two concerts allowing all these people to make their dream comes true. This is not just a frivolous attitude, this is not even mocking.

I am writing from a producer of Karaoke Tracks in the UK (Dorset) called Vocal Star Limited.  
We, along with all other Karaoke producers have been informed from PRS that we are no longer able to sell any Adele tracks for digital or streaming of karaoke purposes.  In January, no Adele tracks will be allowed on disc either. 
This means no Karaoke company will be able to supply any Adele tracks in any format what so ever, meaning your fans will not be able to sing along to your tracks at home, in karaoke bars or anywhere in Karaoke form. 
We as one of the largest suppliers of Karaoke music and products know that this is going to upset a lot of fans around the World.
I can‚Äôt believe that you are aware of this, or would accept this and we would love to hear some official comment on this.

Pick any tired phrase you like:
Shit happens!
It's only money!
Life goes on!
They're all true. Make the most of the situation, and spend time in the big L doing fun things.
If the shows can't be rescheduled you'll get your ticket money back.
But if they CAN be rescheduled, you're probably in for a treat! The band I wanted to see rescheduled, and that concert was two hours of performance from musicians absolutely HELL BENT on giving all of their returning fans more than enough value for money!

You made every one of us at that concert feel like you were our friend, and that you were thankful to us for being there.  Are you kidding me??!!  You are a MEGA talent and yet you have remained true to yourself - a gorgeous, funny, humble, REAL person with a voice like no other.  I will be a fan for life after seeing who you are.  Your show was more about spending an evening with you than hearing your singing, which was not what I expected.  You really are an amazing human being.

I wish I could sit you down, with a glass of wine, and tell you myself that you have nothing to apologize for and that you are simply amazing as a person (and obviously as a singer).  You gave the world your all, and you simply have no more.  As a mom of two special needs children, I get this!!!  Parenting them is my greatest source of happiness but I never know when I'm going to be running on fumes and have no more to give.  And at times I have to say ""no more"" and let others down.  I surround myself with people who understand when I just can't give anymore and don't judge when I bail on them.  If your fans don't read this and understand, then give them their money back and don't think twice about it.  If they only love you for your talent, let them download a song or something.  Those who admire you for all that you are will understand. 

Take care, rest and don't beat yourself up.  There will be other chances to put yourself out there for others.  We need that gorgeous voice of yours to stay strong, and for your contagious laugh, and your amazing soul to remain open and real!!

why do i mention this? because on that basis it would be also possible to do sometimes single concerts from time to time on an almost no-cost-basis. come - sing - stay for a few holidays - leave for home.

So you had booked hotels and flights/trains to go to the concert, Wembley isnt in the middle of nowhere its in the outskirts of London.  You could have still used the transport and hotels to have a good weekend away.
We all bought our tickets months ago and had been looking forward to the concets this weekend and are all hugely disappointed but would you risk causing more damage to your health if your doctor said enough is enough??

Unfortunately, the performance of a voice of singer cannot be guaranteed and sometimes a singer is facing events that require it to take a long rest.

When I noticed that something was wrong with my voice, at first I thought it was a beginning of infection. The medical examination, however, has given a different result: the side effects of a medicine made burst a small vein on my vocal cords.

So I must stop singing until the haematoma has completely subsided. To avoid permanent damage.",Yvonne Silvie,2017-07-15 11:10:18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Train tickets ¬£120- hotel ¬£255 running total so far ¬£575- decide to go on bus tour round London for 2 hours as it's lovely weather cost ¬£45-new running total ¬£620 - well wrong bus!as we went round BACK of Buck House through fucking Paddington & Victoria-why?  And sorry do not want to see Finance Area - ok went over Tower Bridge etc saw some well known sights but obviously ripped off.  Got off bus sweaty & I kept saying we should have been getting ready to see Adele now- instead sat outside Great Northern in lovely sun - can I please have 1/2 lager & lime-no we only served bottled oh why am I not surprised? -ok then glass of wine at cost of ¬£8! hubby 3 bottles beer later & me 3 glasses of 75 cl wine at cost of ¬£45!  Don't get me wrong knew what we were doing but what a rip off- prior to bus trip went to pub round corner hubby had Sunday lunch ¬£12 quid ok for London  couple of beers  & 1 coffee ¬£ 35 running total ¬£700 and we haven even had evening meal yet!  FFS lot of money to not see my idol!  So just want you to know we would have been making our way to Wembley early but instead of seeing you have decided now to drink  in sun ( bad choice)  & basically get pissed- as you are only here once-have now woke from nice little nap so let's hit the bar as we should have been seeing the beautiful Adele- just want you to know we Will hopefully see you soon and want you to get better & do not feel bad about letting people down - as it cannot be helped- I am now going to find a Tesco Express or whatever to get some cheaper booze after a meal somewhere reasonably priced & basically get pissed & have a ciggie outside first with my ¬£8 glass of wine!  Don't get me wrong I know London prices only too well & love London just having a little rant.  I hope you are at home Adele doing the same -re the remarks earlier if she stopped smoking & swearing she wouldn't lose her voice?  What the fuck has swearing got to do with losing your voice?  Stay focused & calm lovely lady & enjoy your hubby & little boy & hopefully later this year we will see you- if not still got your fantastic albums to listen to much loveüòòüòä xx,Gillian Cooling-Brown,2017-07-02 14:21:52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then I get the email from Songkick that these gigs(the original Finale gig was July 1st at Wembley)was not going to be rescheduled I think & I'm sure many many others feel is very rash.

You may not have complete two big shows, but you are still beautiful and brave and you have this all and everything you could, the fire has not burned out, it‚Äôs on just begun and Wembley will always be there for you without doubt. Your fans believe in you and you need to believe in yourself and be proud of the 121 shows you did. That‚Äôs truly amazing and a major accomplishment all by itself. I want you not be hard on yourself and love yourself and that means give yourself some well deserved self-care and spend time with your son and hubby and family. Rest up because without any doubt you will triumphantly return to the stage!

How can people behave like that as its the bad things people remember and take to heart not the positive comments and well wishes. Yes my step daughter is devastated that the show has been cancelled as its all she has talked about but she isn't being negative. The professionalism and heart felt anguish in which Adele has written about the cancellation goes to show what a true down to earth woman she is. She could have gone on stage and then walked off but she isn't like the spoilt brats that are so called pop music now. She could have gone on stage and mimed but she would have been slated for not singing. Either way she can't win in some people's eyes.

She has gone so out of HER way. She could have stuck to CDs and iTunes. Still would have made millions . For people to moan how much money and time they have lost , take it up with the ticket suppliers hotel managers (can imagine Adele cringing at this , how many lol) .. but don't put it on her.

& to all the fans expressing their disappointment, trying to guilt trip her & get something extra out of it...get a grip!

The woman is a global superstar but underneath everything - she is human.

She said she will try to re-schedule, so give her time to rest and she'll get back to you!

Some people have not had the luxury of getting tickets for whatever reason, so if she reschedules, you are still luckier than others! Be patient.

& if you are still moaning about not being able to attend her concert this weekend...think of whats happened over the past few months, it'll put things in to perspective....

btw. we came from vienna to see you (because adele doesn't come to the city of music). and even if it would have been one of the cancelled concerts: we wouldn't demand our money back, but keep our tickets and come again to wembley to see that incredible show. would it be worth it? definitely! goosebumps!!!

To be frank with you I do not usually listen to foreign songs so much so that I last heard and listened was the Careless Whisper  song. A short time ago I and my child 8 year old, who was watching TV  ,Suddenly, you appeared on the screen with the song ( some one like you ). A terrible merger with the lyrics of the song It was apparent to my son.
And to be more frank with you I came back and listened to this song in particular as you are in this song has stirred emotions so much that I have tears in my eyes.
Thank you my friend for this high sense, and thank you because you are moving my high human feelings.

‚ÄúMy desire is not after these men, neither is my longing after blood but mercy. Let every man lay down his arms and go his ways, and let peace be in the land, and joy wait upon your feet.‚Äù

When the men heard this they praised the Shah, and called down blessings upon his head. And they came before him, every man bearing his armour and the weapons of battle. And they laid them at his feet, and of weapons there was reared a mighty mountain, and the blue steel glistened in the sun. Then Minuchihr dismissed them graciously. And when the army was dispersed he sent a messenger unto Feridoun bearing the head of Silim and a writing. And when he had ordered all things he set out at the head of his warriors unto the city of Feridoun. And his grandsire came forth to meet him, and there came with him many elephants swathed in gold, and warriors arrayed in rich attire, and a large multitude clad in garments of bright hue. And flags waved above them, and trumpets brayed, and cymbals clashed, and sounds of rejoicing filled the air. But when Minuchihr saw that his grandsire came towards him, he got from his horse and ran to meet him, and fell at his feet and craved his blessing. And Feridoun blessed Minuchihr and raised him from the dust. And he bade him sit again upon his horse and took his hand, and they entered the city in triumph. And when they were come to the King‚Äôs house, Feridoun seated Minuchihr upon a throne of gold. Then he called unto him Saum, the son of Neriman, and said ‚Äî

‚ÄúI pray thee bring up this youth and nourish him for the kingdom, and aid him with thy might and mind.‚Äù

And he took the hand of Minuchihr and put it into that of Saum, and said ‚Äî

I love your voice.  I love your style.  Ever since the first time I heard you, I thought there is absolutely no other who compares.  I'm just one of your many, many fans.  I doubt I would have ever been able to afford one of your concerts.  Both tickets or the trip to a bigger city would have been a big dent in my savings.  But I never get tired of your voice and style even with the way American radio stations seem to play a song to death when it first comes out.  LAUGH.  I heard a DJ say some other person, dare I say artist, wanted to out sell or out do you. He's ok.  For a 'mussed' redhead.  I admit to using one of his tunes for a ringtone.  Shrug.   What seemed to be his first two hit got real old real fast.

I saw your very moving note to your Wembley fans.  I so pray your throat gets better.   For you and your health and family most of all.  I hope your two men in your life really know how fortunate they are to have you.  I would be so proud to be your mom. A quite youthful mom or a bit older sister.  Laugh.  

I will stop so I don't ramble longer.  Giggle.

Sincerely,

Beth

I know you would never cancel such an inportant show if It wasn't for a really good reason. And of course I wish you get well soon. But I also have to admit that I am more then disappointed. I have bee looking forward to seeing you in concert for a long long time and it took me a while to save enough money to afford the ticket, flight and hotel to come all the way from Germany. So all in all I spend almost 1000 Euro of my hard earned money for nothing. And i didn't get any conpensation at all. I know people can get sick and there is nothing u can do about it. But why do we, your fans, have to pay for it. Today I got the refund for my ticket from Eventim. And guess what I didn't even get back what I payed for. All I got was the face value. What about the sevice fee, shipping cost...? So not only that I lost my money for fligh and hotel. I also lost 20 Pounds on the ticket which I will never see again. 
I am just really disappointed about the whole situation. I don't blame you for cancelling the show, not at all. But I think we deserver something better than a refund on the face value of the ticket. U got more money than u will ever be able to spend in your life. So you shouldn't let your fans pay for your health problems. 
I am really sad about that.
But anyway, please get well soon and go on with your music which makes us all feel good in so many ways.",John Muennekhoff,2017-07-06 08:07:00,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm so disappointed you are taking the steps to make sure your voice doesn't go out on you.  Shame on you for wanting to keep your vocal chords from damaging further.  
And I'm stunned you would even consider writing such a heartfelt letter to let us plebs, demonstrating how much you truly care. I mean, com'on, its not like you haven't sung your brains out over 121 shows and belted out song after song at each one.  Gosh, and here I thought you truly cared about us, especially me.  Single me.  Who happens to be utterly heartbroken you won't sing directly for me now.  Whatever was I thinking that you were super human and given turbo God stamina. I guess if you really feel like you need to not hurt yourself anymore I imagine I can muster up the will to not be deeply and overly offended.

OK... so for those of you who don't get the over the top sarcasm from above, please note I in no way shape or form think Adele should continue singing.  It would be far more of a tragedy if something were to actually happen to her singing voice if we were to actually demand she sing. I hope you get better Ms. Adele.

2: Almost all fans already waited hours in online ques to get tickets so why not make the same tickets we have already bought valid for a possible rescheduled concert? That way long ticket ques can be avoid and everyone gets their seats what they purchased before.

It really KILLS  me.Don't say that I'm of no compassion, I've planned this trip half a year ago, there was only 2 shows (6/30,7/1) in the first place , I didn't get the ticket from official so I had no choice but to get it on resale , spent ¬£350 for an original ¬£100 ticket. Then because of the huge demand , she opened up 2 more show (6/28, 7/2). 4 shows in a row , who can do that ? Then now just cancel the original show , how's all this ever make sense?

The last thing we fans want to see is that you crumble in the stage, which will be most heartbreaking thing. You don't have to say sorry for the decision, cause we totally support you and you've done nothing wrong. Please do take care of yourself and get well soon. You've never ever disappointed us. We will always love you. You are the best.‚ù§Ô∏è

But sometimes we forget that artists are not magicians.
They are not on batteries which you can change if they stop delivering.

They are humans and you cannot control what your health is telling you and considering the fact she is singing for 2 hours live every night, over 100 concerts, performing around the world, of course it affects her voice.

I don't think anyone is mad, it's illogical to be angry for something nobody can control, no matter how good you take care of yourself.

I honestly hope that she will recover, that's the most important thing right now.
Selling records is one thing, priority of your physical and mental health should always be number 1.

We (to use your favourite cursing word) FUCKING adore you and we love you Adele üíôüíöüíú
The fans are still here, we are not going anywhere and you will still have our gratitude and love in sickness and in health üíôüíú
